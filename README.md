My First Bioinformatics Project defining Python Functions that identifies possible Protein sequences from DNA and RNA Sequences.

The Raw_Toolkit contains the independent functions defined and utilized initially while the Cleaned_Toolkit contains a class called "bio_seq" which contains all the functionalities contained in the Raw_Toolkit
